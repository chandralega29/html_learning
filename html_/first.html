        <p>This page contains the tags I learned today.</p>

         <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
         <p>HTML is the structure of a webpage. I learned basic tags such as headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and horizontal lines.</p>     
         
         <h3>Headings</h3>
         <p>Headings range from h1 to h6. They help differentiate titles and subtitles.</p>      
         
         <h3>*Paragraph*</h3>
         <p>Paragraphs display blocks of text. Inside a paragraph, I can also use a line break like this:<br>Here is the next line.</p>
         <hr>

         <p>That's all for the mini task of Day One 🙂.</p>
